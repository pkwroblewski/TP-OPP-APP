# TP Opportunity Finder – Cursor rules
- Always propose code edits as a unified diff unless I ask for inline.
- Only touch these paths unless I say otherwise:
  src/app/api/**, worker/**, supabase/migrations/**, scripts/**, render.yaml
- Do not edit unrelated files. No refactors beyond scope.
- Never commit secrets. Use env vars.
- Prefer deterministic tools & pinned versions. No LLMs in core extraction.
- After applying changes, stage, commit, and push with the message provided.
